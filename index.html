          <h2>Why I Felt Safer in Lockdown Than at College</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My love letter to introverts everywhere. In my very first <a href="https://medium.com/@jane_park/why-i-felt-safer-in-lockdown-than-at-college-85bb37be4165" target="_blank">blog post</a>, I share the challenges of having had to begin my freshman year of college during the COVID-19 pandemic, which deeply impacted my mental health and social life.

          <h2>Tips and Experiences on Overcoming Body Image Struggles on Social Media</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/esther-wang-549928629/bodyimagepodcast?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">podcast</a>, five other college students and I candidly discuss feeling vulnerable as teens and young adults against social media's unrealistic — and deceptive — beauty standards. We also share our journeys of how we've overcome these struggles or how we're in the process of doing so.</p>

          <h2>embracing my heritage through crunchwraps</h2>
          <p class="description">
            This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAlfrUb55Nw" target="_blank">tutorial</a> of how to make bulgogi crunchwraps. I touch on struggles many children of immigrants face, such as feeling torn between their nationality and ethnicity, but how I've personally used food to tackle them. The crunchwrap is a blend of Korean and American/non-Korean food to respect that I am Korean-American.</p>

          <h2>Ukrainian Hokies reflect on ongoing invasion</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I'm also a news writer for the Collegiate Times. I consider this <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/ukrainian-hokies-reflect-on-ongoing-invasion/article_9c0e5a80-b92d-11ec-8bf5-d7220ee16bb8.html" target="_blank">article</a> as one of my most significant ones as it reveals how Ukrainian students and faculty were coping with Russia's invasion of their home and how Virginia Tech could support them.</p>
