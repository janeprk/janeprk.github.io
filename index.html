          <h2>Why I Felt Safer in Lockdown Than at College</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My love letter to introverts everywhere. My first <a href="https://medium.com/@jane_park/why-i-felt-safer-in-lockdown-than-at-college-85bb37be4165" target="_blank">blog post</a> shares the challenges of beginning my freshman year of college amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which deeply impacted my mental health and social life. Yet I improved my wellbeing without compromising my boundaries and personality.</p>

          <h2>Tips and Experiences on Overcoming Body Image Struggles on Social Media</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/esther-wang-549928629/bodyimagepodcast?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">podcast</a>, five other college students and I candidly discuss feeling vulnerable as teens and young adults against social media's unrealistic — and deceptive — beauty standards. We also share our journeys of how we've overcome these struggles or how we're still doing so.</p>

          <h2>Embracing my heritage through crunchwraps</h2>
          <p class="description">
            This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAlfrUb55Nw" target="_blank">tutorial</a> explains how to make bulgogi crunchwraps. I mention some struggles many children of immigrants face, such as feeling torn between their nationality and ethnicity, but how I've personally used food to tackle them. The crunchwrap blends Korean and American/non-Korean food to respect my Korean-American identity.</p>

          <h2>Ukrainian Hokies reflect on ongoing invasion</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I'm also a news writer for the Collegiate Times. I consider this <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/ukrainian-hokies-reflect-on-ongoing-invasion/article_9c0e5a80-b92d-11ec-8bf5-d7220ee16bb8.html" target="_blank">article</a> very significant because I spoke with Ukrainian students and faculty, revealing how they're coping with Russia's invasion of their home and how Virginia Tech could support them.</p>
